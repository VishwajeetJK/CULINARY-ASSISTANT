# CULINARY-ASSISTANT

● The First Objective is the Image Recognition of dishes using Deep Learning. We will
be using Convolutional Neural Networks to detect the dish present in the image so
that the user can upload the photograph of the dish and the model will return the name
of the dish.

● The second objective on which we will be focussing is the recommendation system
which will recommend complimentary dishes to the user related to the dish in the
photograph which the user has uploaded. This will help the user get insights about the
other side dishes which are often taken with that main dish.

● We will also be creating Rest APIs to host our models on the web app and we will
also be identifying the APIs which will give us the recipe of the dishes. Finally, will
make the front end for the web app which should be user friendly and very intuitive in
nature. It shall attempt to request the APIs with an image of the dish and display the
recipe and recommendations back on itself.
